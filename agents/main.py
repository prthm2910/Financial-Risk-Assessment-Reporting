"""

This module defines the FastAPI backend service that powers the financial
risk analysis and ESG insight generation system. It exposes API endpoints
for triggering the agent pipeline and retrieving server logs.

Endpoints:
    - POST /run_agent: Trigger the multi-agent risk and ESG analysis for a given company.
    - GET /logs: Return in-memory logs of requests and events for the current day.

Features:
    - Asynchronous I/O for non-blocking agent execution
    - Thread-safe in-memory logging with daily rollover
    - CORS support for frontend integration (e.g., Streamlit, React)
